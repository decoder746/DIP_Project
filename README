The only file you have to run is util.py
TO run it enter the following command:-
python3 util.py <image-name>
Then it outputs two images corresponding to the otsu thresholding and adaptive thresholding of the input-image.

The naming structure of images is as follows:-
Input-image == x.png
Otsu thresholded image == xotsu.png
Adaptive thresholded image == xadaptive.png
